5-Day Workshop on Neural Networks, OpenCV, ANN, CNN & Movie Recommendation System

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains resources, code, and notes from a 5-day workshop where we explored the fundamentals of Neural Networks, OpenCV, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Data Preprocessing. As a hands-on project, we built a Movie Recommendation System using machine learning techniques.
